The setup for this system is like this

Wall -- Spring -- Bob
--------Floor--------

Wall:
- Wall's center of its right side serves as the origin for the system
- Wall serves as an anchor point for the spring
- Wall's mass is undefined
- Wall should display as a line on the right side with lines


Spring:
- Massless
- Anchored to wall's right center
- Connected to a bob on the right
- Equations of motion require a bob on the right
- Equations of motion describe the width delta of the spring
- Starting width depends on position of wall and bob
- Spring should display with horizontal_spring

Bob:
- Has mass
- Anchored to spring's right center
- Tracks history of its center
- mostly a dumb object

Floor:
- Shows where the spring and bob contact the floor.
- There's no friction (yet).
- Floor's mass is undefined
