# Physics Simulations (2016)

## About

I really enjoy learning about physics in addition to programming. Recently, 
I was looking into Lagrangian mechanics and decided to make some simulations 
using Processing and Python.

So far, I've made the following simulations:

* Horizontal spring
* Two horizontal springs
* Planets orbiting a sun/larger planet
* Pendulum
* Double Pendulum.

## Dependencies

* [Processing](https://processing.org)
* [Processing Python Plugin](http://py.processing.org/)

## Setup

Create an environment variable `SKETCHBOOK_LIBS` and set it equal to the path 
to the `physics-simulations/libraries` directory.

## Example

`export SKETCHBOOK_LIBS=/path/to/physics-simulations/libraries`

In Windows, this needs to be done through 
`Control Panel > System and Security > System > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables`

## Usage

Open one of the `.pyde` sketches in Processing with the Python plugin 
enabled. Then simply run the sketch.
